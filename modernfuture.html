<!--First Body paragraph-->
<h1 id="main-heading">The Browsers of Today</h1>
<p>Jumping ahead to today, numerous competitors have joined the market landscape
such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Opera GX, etc. Released in 2008, Google
Chrome would assert its dominance over the browser market over the next decade.
But how could a newcomer compete with giants such as Microsoft’s Internet Explorer?
By building an entirely new type of browser. Contrasting to Microsoft’s closed-source
approach, Google decided to make the project open-source. According to Cofounder Hiten
Shah of nira.com, they state, “Open source gave Google a much better way to consistently
improve Chrome as a product… It aligned strongly with open-web standards that were 
becoming increasingly popular”. With the source code readily available for anyone to 
modify or view this allowed Chrome’s team to refine the code to be as fast as possible.
That combined with the introduction of third-party plug-ins in 2009, made Chrome completely
customizable to suit the user’s needs. In 2015 Microsoft’s later iteration Microsoft
Edge had a rough time maintaining their portion of the market, pushing developers 
to a drastic change. According to Preston Gralla of computerworld.com, they state,
“The old Edge, now known as Edge Legacy, was filled with countless unnecessary 
features… with Chromium Edge, all that goes away.”. Making the switch in 2019,
the new Edge offers a comparable experience to Chrome itself with a clean 
user-interface and quick search times. In today’s world the search for the best
browser is often subjective as different browsers can be tailored to meet their      
users’ needs.</p>

<!--Second Body paragraph-->
<p>Over the past couple of years, we’ve seen the introduction of artificial intelligence(s)
(AI) such as ChatGPT and DeepSeek. Major browsers and search engines have already begun
to implement this technology into the web browsers themselves. However, companies like
OpenAI and Perplexity are developing brand new browsers around AI, which could fundamentally
change the way we navigate the internet. Apps like Dia and Comet have yet to be released
, but they include functionality not found in other browsers. According to of the New York
Times, they state, “In contrast, Chatbots like ChatGPT, Gemini and Claude require opening
a separate tab or app and pasting in content for the chatbot to evaluate and answer 
questions”. While Dia is active the assistant is alongside you the whole time, ready to
answer questions and perform tasks at a moment’s notice; even switching models to achieve
the best results. Although the results are great, developers in the industry are not 
satisfied yet. The desire for more “argentic” browsers is pushing developers to create
technology that doesn’t just assist but acting independently on their user’s behalf. 
According to windowsforum.com, it states, “The integration of AI into browsers offers
numerous benefits, including increased efficiency and personalized assistance. 
However, it also raises significant questions regarding privacy and data security”.
As this technology continues to evolve so do the ethical and moral questions 
surrounding privacy and security. If we continue to abide by our conduct by these
questions, AI can revolutionize the user experience and the world as we know it.
