    <!-- Detailed Explanations -->
    <h2 id = "subsection">Fundamental Languages of Frontend Development</h2>
    <div class="abstract">
        <p1>The creation of dynamic and interactive interfaces is very important in modern web development.
This creation improves the user experience. Thanks to frontend technologies such as HTML, CSS,
and JavaScript, a website can allow interaction and feedback, meaning it does not just display static
information. So, the goal of Milestone #2 is to apply these concepts.</p1>
<br>
<br>
    
    
    <p1><strong>HTML:</strong>The basic language of the web is HTML. This language is responsible for giving a good structure to
the browser content. HTML uses various tags to define headings, paragraphs, links, images, forms,
and many other elements.
Each tag has a specific, well-defined function, and together they allow the logical structure of the site
to be built.
In Milestone #2, HTML is used to create the different pages of the site, which uses forms
and different types of inputs like radio, checkbox, and button functions.<p1>
<br>
<br>
    <p1><strong>CSS:</strong> CSS is the language that is used to define the visual appearance of a web page. Just as HTML is
responsible for giving content a good structure, CSS is responsible for good visual appearance,
controlling colors, fonts, sizes, etc. It keeps the code cleaner, reusable, and easier to maintain.
In this project, CSS is used to maintain a professional appearance for the site, applying consistent
styles throughout all pages.
<br>
<br>
    <p1><strong>JavaScript:</strong> On the other hand, we have JavaScript, which is a programming language that allows adding
interactivity and a dynamic touch to web pages, making it possible for the web to respond to the user's
actions.
In this project, JavaScript is used to control the functioning of the quiz:
<ol class = concepts-list>
    <li>Check the user's answers.</li>
    <li>Calculate the total score.</li>
    <li>Display the results and feedback directly on the same page.</li>
    <li>Allow the quiz to be restarted for another attempt.</li>
</ol> 
<h2 id = "subsection">Forms and User Interaction</h2>
<br>
<p1>User data entry is possible thanks to HTML forms. These forms can include different types of
controls, such as text fields, buttons, checkboxes, or radio buttons.
In Milestone #2, these forms could be said to be the basis of the quiz, as each question is represented
by appropriate controls, which are as follows:</p1>
<ol class = concepts-list>
    <li>Radio buttons: These are used for questions where only one answer can be selected from a list of options.</li>
    <li>Checkboxes: These are used for questions where multiple answers can be selected from a list of options.</li>
    <li>Buttons: These are used to submit the quiz and restart it for another attempt.</li>
    <li> Text field for questions that must be completed manually.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<p1>Since the user has to perform an action here,that means that has to interact with the website,
JavaScript is used to handle the data. It evaluates the answers and displays the results.The user interface (UI) design is a very important point that we have to take into consideration when
we create a website. A well-designed site should be visual, clear, and easy to use.
In Milestone #2, we have been asked to use certain UI requirements when organizing the website
content. We have to create the quiz on a separate page (one per page) and include it in our website's
main menu, including certain types of questions, using a professional style with a consistent color
scheme, and simple navigation.
