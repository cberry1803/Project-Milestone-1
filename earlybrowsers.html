<h1>Before the World Wide Web</h1>
<p>Starting in the Pre-Web era, the first step in this evolution would be credited 
to software engineer Tim Berners-Lee while working for CERN’s particle physics laboratory.
 With a degree in physics from Queen’s College and experience at notable companies such as
  Plessey Telecommunications, D.G. Nash Ltd, and Image Computer Systems Ltd; spending his 
  early career working on commercial technology and typesetting software. In his biography 
  on w3.org, it states, “Whilst there, he wrote for his own private use his first program 
  for storing information including using random associations”. This program he dubbed 
  “Enquire” would serve as the foundation for a larger global hypertext project, and in 
  1990 he would release the “WorldWideWeb” program; the first Web Browser. According to
   geeksforgeeks.org, it states, “It was indeed an extraordinary development as it was 
   the only web browser present at the time which provided a user-friendly interface”. 
   The user-interface or UI is the cornerstone of making the internet more accessible,
    furthering education and knowledge of mankind.</p>

<p>From a user perspective, we use browsers to do things like check our email, shop online,
     or for personal entertainment. It is very straightforward for anyone who has used a 
     computer. However, there are complex processes occurring behind the scenes to present 
     to you the information you are looking for as you browse the web. The purpose of a 
     browser is to translate the hypertext markup language (HTML) by using the hypertext 
     transfer protocol (HTTP).  This displays text, images, and videos in a way that is 
     palatable for the user. In the article What is a Web Browser and How Does It Work? 
     Author John Gormally states, “You’re actually calling up a list of requests to get 
     content from various resource directories or servers on which the content for that 
     page is stored”. I like to think of the browser as an assembly line for a car. 
     Firstly, when you type in a uniform resource locator (URL) you are instructing the 
     browser to fetch the IP address associated with that name and the specified resources
      within it. Each section and subsection of the URL is important for locating the 
      correct information, like specifying what kind of parts you want for your car. 
      Secondly, the browser sends a request to the server(s), and the server(s) returns 
      the request with the content; typically, code such as HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. 
      The browser does this by using the hypertext transfer protocol HTTP or its secured 
      counterpart HTTPS. This acts like the employees, decoding the list of parts and 
      collecting them for assembly. Next, the code is parsed and is organized into a 
      tree structure, as determined in the code, in a DOM or Document Object Model. 
      The model is then rendered by the browser’s engine to, and the pieces are assembled 
      to their proper place. This is like the frame of the car and assembling the doors, 
      wheels, engine etc. Then the JavaScript is executed to enable all the interactive
      elements of the page. This is akin to wiring the car since at this stage we have all 
      the structure but no functionality yet. Finally, the final touches are added to 
      the pages visual, the page composites, and the final complete page is returned to 
      the user. This would be like the final tune up before you receive your new car.
